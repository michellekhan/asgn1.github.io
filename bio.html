    <p style="text-align:center">I was born in Cambodia, and I have been living in the United States for the last 16 years of my life. I work full-time and go to school as well. Addition to my crazy schedule, I have two children that keep me away from troubles. I believe that nothing comes easy in life, people must work hard for what they desire. I push myself to get better because I believe in my ability; however, it is not always easy.</p> <br>
    <em><p style="text-align:center">~~ Never give up and keep pushing forward is the lessons that can not be taught by anyone but yourself. ~~</em></p>
